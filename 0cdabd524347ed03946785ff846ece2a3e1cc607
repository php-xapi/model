Can you also add an entry to the changelog?

After thinking about this again I think we should do the following:

* trigger a deprecation in the constructor when an `Actor` that is no `Agent` is passed
* deprecate the `getActor()` method
* add the `getAgent()` method

We can then merge this into the `1.x` branch. What do you think?

@xabbuh Done. Any feedback on this ?

@xabbuh Should I also change the version from `1.1.1` to `1.2` as in #55 here ?

@Lctrs Oh, yes indeed please.
